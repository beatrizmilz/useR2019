## Important points!

- The group provides a safe environment for people interested in `R`. 
   - Code of conduct: [https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#portuguese](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#portuguese)

- All of the content presented is made available freely on github in portuguese:

   - [https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_sao-paulo](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_sao-paulo)

- **All of the activities are free to attend**
  - The gratuityis very relevant in the Brazilian context:
  the few `R` courses available in Portuguese are often expensive, and there is no other active `R` group in São Paulo (the biggest city in Brazil!).

## Conclusion

- The increasing popularity of the R-Ladies São Paulo shows us how important it is to support it, 

- It can be the key to motivate the creation of other chapters in Brazil, 

- It helps to increase the strength of the Brazilian R community and the inclusion of underrepresented groups.
