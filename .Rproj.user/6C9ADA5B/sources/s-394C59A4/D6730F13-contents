## Important points

- The group provides a safe environment for people interested in R. Code of condut:
   - [https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#portuguese](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#portuguese)

- All of the content presented is made available on github in portuguese, so anyone can access it:

   - [https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_sao-paulo](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_sao-paulo)

- All of the activities are free to attend. The gratuity of the activities is very relevant in the Brazilian context, since the few R courses available in Portuguese are often expensive, and there is no other active R group in Sao Paulo.

## Conclusion

- The increasing popularity of the R-Ladies São Paulo shows us how important it is to support it, what can be the key to motivate the creation of other chapters in Brazil and increase the strength of the Brazilian R community, and the inclusion of unrepresented groups.
